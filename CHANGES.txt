version 0.6.0

- several bugs have been detected and removed
- added possibility to reconstruct unlimited large scenes in highest possible level of detail see ini\README.txt
- added possibility to simplify mesh into choosen number of triangles 
- added possibility to create new mesh with one texture file (merge texture files)
- added possibility for beta testing of the first version of our final mesh refinement step (still in developement)
- added possibility for testing of experimental version of better texturing approach
- added possibility to generate georeferenced DEM and ortoPhoto
- more parameters described

version 0.5

- several critical bugs have been detected and removed
- added visualSfM_CMPMVS.bat for complete 3D reconstruction just from images using VisualSfM (v0.5.18 and higher) + CMPMVS
- you can use parameters doComputeDEMandOrtoPhoto, doGenerateVideoFrames to turn on and off (default is on) the dem+ortoPhoto and video computation
